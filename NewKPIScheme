# Background

Over time, the KPI scheme has seen many iterations. We think it's gotten better over time, but as many of you have pointed out, and we are fully aware of, there are still quite a few flaws. With the growth in participation and activity, this is becoming more and more of a problem.

With the new testnet launch, we'll have three operations groups instead of the one we have currently. We are also getting a lot closer to mainnet, where the actual SoW for the Council won't really be that closely aligned with many of the JOYtasks that are currently found in the KPIs. On mainnet, the Council should:
1. Allocate the platforms resources
2. Drive the development of the platform
3. Make sure the WG Leads are on top of their workers, and each of their systems are running well
4. Although mostly a subset of 1-3, vote on proposals.

The new system will attempt to get us closer to this "world", provide more opportunities for everyone, not just CMs, to learn about the system and/or perform valuable JOYtasks for the platform, while earning FM points and some fiat along the way.

# Definition of Terms
- `Applicant` - meaning a person applying for a JOYtask
- `Assignee` - meaning a person or group assigned a JOYtask
- `Budget` - meaning the amount of Funds that is added to the Fiat Pool over a Council Term. The Council is of course free to spend more than that for any given Term, but one would hope that would be disciplined by the voters.
- `(Council) Term` - meaning the time a Council is seated.
- `JOYtask` - meaning WIP term replacing a KPI, Bounty, OKRs, etc.
- `JOYtask Manager` - meaning the Lead (and designated) Workers of the Operations Group Gamma. Responsible for assigning, managing and grading each JOYtask
- `JOYtask Participant` - meaning both (potential and active) Applicants and Assignees in JOYtasks
- `JOYtask Survey` - meaning a survey all JOYtask Participants fill out after completion, regardless of the outcome
- `Opening` - meaning, in the context of a JOYtask, an on-chain concept where JOYtask Participants can apply, and get assigned a JOYtask

# Incentives Summary
The main changes to the incentives system are made to remove Jsgenesis from the equation as far as possible, and design the system in a way where as much as possible can be utilized on the mainnet.

## OKRs
**All** WGs will have a large part of their rewards tied to OKRs.
  - The Council will monitor and grade for all groups except their own
  - After a transitional period, Operations Group Gamma will monitor and grade the Councils OKRs

## Recurring Rewards
For most, if not all, Working Groups, the recurring rewards, in combination with OKRs, will be the only source of rewards.

## JOYtasks
Instead of having Council KPIs and Bounties, all "extraordinary" tasks will called JOYtasks.
- These will be created by Jsgenesis, in a collaborative process with the Council and group Leads.
- In general, these will be made available for all platform participants, instead of being directed at the Council Members and WG Leads exclusively.
- In some cases, certain restrictions will be applied, to make sure:
  - newcomers have a chance to contribute
  - the work is reserved for, or against, Members in a particular WG, to ensure that the person has the knowledge required or there is no conflict of interest
  - require staking, to avoid "squatting"
- They will be managed and created by a new Working Group, the Operations Group Gamma.
- All rewards will be paid out through the Proposal System.

The workflow from the JOYtask Participants PoV can be found [here](#joytask-participant), whereas the workflow from the JOYtask Manager PoV can he found [here](#joytask-manager),

## FM Points
A way to ease a lot of the FM grading, and make it more transparent would be to make the FM Points awarded be a function of the rewards earned. Of course, there will always be ways to contribute and earn FM points not captured by this system.

## Platform Budget
In addition to the existing Fiat Pool, Jsgenesis would at the beginning of a new Council Term, top it up with a certain amount of funds. This would form the basis of the budget for that Term. If not deterministic, it would be announced alongside the new set of JOYtasks. The Council would then have to allocate resources between the following:
- JOYtasks
- Working Groups
  - [Operations Group Alpha](#operations-group-alpha) (OP-A)
  - [Operations Group Beta](#operations-group-beta) (OP-B)
  - [Operations Group Gamma](#operations-group-gamma) (OP-G)
  - [Content Curators](#content-curators) (CC)
  - [Storage Providers and (Content) Distribution Groups](#storage-and-distribution-groups) (SP/CD)
- Reserves, to keep in case of:
  - New and extra tasks appearing
  - Spending Proposals (outside of JOYtasks)
  - Miscalculation of costs -> requiring additional funding for a group
  - other

In addition to that, some percentage of the funds allocated to a Working Group must be made available to the group for recurring rewards, whereas another amount must be reserved for OKR payments. As the system settles, one will get a better idea of how much this should be.

After the OKR results are in, Jsgenesis will use these, in addition to reviewing the total value of the new and recurring JOYtasks, to adjust the budget for the next Term. Due to the overhead and dependencies associated with all this, and the fact that the Council and Working Groups will no longer be the only way to earn a significant "income" by participating, it seems beneficial to elongate the Council Terms from the current 1 week, to 2 or even 4 weeks.

# JOYtask Participant
This Section focuses on the actions required by a general member of the Joystream Platform, that wants to earn rewards and FM points.

## JOYtask Workflow
The Workflow

### JOYtasks Published
Before a new Term starts, a new batch of JOYtasks will be published. Already now, you can start to consider which of the JOYtask(s) you think are most interesting to you from the Scope of Work, associated Rewards and potential deadlines. You can also ask clarifying questions, if something is unclear.

These will be made available on the website, and probably other places as well (Pioneer, Discord, joystreamstats.live, Community Repo).

### Openings Created
Within 24h of the Term start, an opening will be created for each JOYtask under "Openings" in Pioneer.

Right away, you can apply to each of these. In some cases, you'll see slight changes to the SoW, (new) deadlines, restrictions and required stakes. The opening will be open at least 24h, possibly longer.

With your membership key, apply to the opening, answering the questions to the best of your ability.

### Assigned
If your Application is good enough, you will be hired for the JOYtask. In addition to completing the Scope of Work (within the allotted time), you are expected to maintain some level of communication with your JOYtask Manager. Exactly how often should be made clear in the Opening.

If you have any questions along the way, find yourself needing an extension, or require assistance, contact your JOYtask Manager.

### Delivering
Before the Deadline expires, submit your work, in the fashion and format defined in the Opening, unless something else has been agreed. Regardless of the above, posting in the applicable Forum Thread is required to make it official. The JOYtask Manager will have some (pre-defined) time to complete grade your work, and create a Spending Proposal to the Council with your Membership key as the destination account.

### Grading and Aftermath
Regardless of the outcome, you'll likely be invited to participate in a survey. Participation will grant:
- a small reward and FM points
- improving your JOYtask reputation (meaning you are more likely to get Assigned another JOYtask in the Future)
- if you have had difficulties with your JOYtask Manager, or some other parts of the process, you have the chance to improve things

At the same time, your JOYtask Manager will prepare a short summary of the experience from their point of view, and your reputation will be updated. This should however not be subjective, and purely calculated from the final outcome.

#### Success
If you accept the results of the grading, and the Council approves the Spending Proposal, the JOYtask is completed, you have received your reward, and you will get "fired" from the Group. Assuming the process and result was within the acceptable terms (ref. the Opening), you will get any potential stake(s) back in full.

#### Bad Outcomes
There are a couple of paths that can induce a conflict or some punishment.

##### Unfair Grading
If you disagree with the grading, you have (at least) two options:
1. Reply to the Proposal, letting the Council know what you think is wrong before they complete the Voting
2. If the Proposal is approved, you can Appeal. This requires creating a Text Proposal, and locking up 20% of the disputed amount (the Lead will create a new Opening where you have to stake). Unless your JOYtask Manager was the OP-G Lead, they will be responsible to review the Grading. Once they have done so, they will:
1. prepare a new Spending Proposal (if they agree with you); or
2. prepare a new Text Proposal (if they disagree with you)

If 1; and the Council approves, you will get the (extra) Reward.
If 2; you will get slashed the 20%. You can appeal one more time to Jsgenesis, without any stake requirements, but if you lose again, your reputation will take a severe hit.

##### Time Elapsed
If you do not deliver your work within the deadline`*`, you will fired, potentially see your entire Role Stake slashed, and tarnish your reputation.

`*` if you think you got an extension, you can Appeal. No other reasons are valid for an appeal.

##### Poor Process
If the Opening required some check-ins, status updates, etc. that the JOYtask Manager claims you did not do, you may be slashed, and/or your reward may be reduced (despite the work being solid). This can be appealed.

# Operations Group Gamma
This Group (OP-G) will be solely responsible for the JOYtasks. Taking a role here will require high availability and some technical experience (especially github and pioneer).

## OKRs
In addition to Recurring Rewards, an OKR system will be deployed to track the performance of the WG.

Some ideas for what can be measured through OKRs:
- Did the Group manage to uphold their deadlines (creating openings, hiring Assignees, grade the JOYtask)?
- How many Appeals (were won by the Assignees)?
- Did Jsgenesis spotchecks find any "bad" grading?
- How did the Assignees grade the process in the surveys?

Lead Only:
- How well did the Lead manage the groups budget (if they "saved" the platform money -> reward, if they overspent -> punish)?
- Did the Lead finish their [Term Start](#term-start) work on time?
- Did the Lead finish their [Term End](#term-end) work on time?

## JOYtask Manager Workflow
To fully understand the groups Scope of Work, one must read this together with the [JOYtask](#joytask-1), where the process is explained from the participants PoV.

### JOYtasks Published
At the beginning of each Term, a batch of new JOYtasks will be published by Jsgenesis. The following will always be specified:
- A scope of work
  - a description of the task(s) to be performed
  - how and where the deliverable shall be submitted
- A USD denominated reward, either
  - as a fixed amount attributed, to be freed if the task is to be considered fully completed and/or within some blockheight
  - as an hourly rate, potentially with a cap
  - a ceiling or budget
Sometimes, depending on the task, some extra details will be specified, such as:
- A completion deadline, meaning when the work should be completed and graded
- A set of JOYtask specific rules, such as
  - a format, eg. "Free For All", "single person only", etc. It should be assumed that in most cases, the JOYtask Manager will decide
  - reserving the JOYtask for, or against some members, based on experience and longevity
  - reserving the JOYtask for, or against some role occupants, such as "no SPs" or "only SPs"
- Grading rules, such as how, and by whom, the grading shall be done

As soon as these are published by Jsgenesis, the OP-G Lead will, in communication with the Workers, assign each JOYtask to a JOYtask Manager. Once a Worker have gotten the JOYtasks to manage, they must create Opening Parameters for each of them, and send them to the Lead. This must include:
- An Application Period, meaning how long that JOYtask shall be open for Applicants
- A max review period, meaning how long after the Application Period is over until the Opening is closed.
- Stake parameters, meaning if there should be any staking requirements for the JOYtask, and if yes, how much they should be, and the length of the relevant unstaking periods.
- The Opening Text, meaning the text that goes in to each OP-G opening, namely a title, the description text which may include
  - any rules
  - format, eg. selection criteria, how many will/may get hired, etc.
  - when the work must be submitted
  - milestones, and/or "other" deadlines
  - questions to ask the Applicants
  - potential punishments if the Member "fails" their JOYtask, or some other failure in the process
  - grading deadline
  - other

All of this must be put in to a valid opening json, so that the OP-G Lead can simply import the json, and create the opening using the CLI.

### Openings Created
When the Openings are created, the JOYtask Managers must create Forum threads for discussion. Whether there should be individual threads per JOYtask, or some other grouping system is at the discretion of the Lead. The JOYtask Managers should be available on Discord as well, but everything that may impact the outcome should be written in the applicable forum thread - even if duplicate.

During this stage, the JOYtask Manager:
- must answer questions and assist potential Applicants
- should "promote" the JOYtask on Discord
- could review the Applications as the come in, to save time later

When the Application Deadline arrives, assuming there are any Applicants (that aren't disqualified), the Opening is moved to the "Review Stage" by the Lead.

### Assigning
As soon as possible after the Opening has been placed in the Review Stage, the JOYtask Manager chooses the Person(s) to assign (in line with the Opening). For obvious reasons, you can not hire yourself, or any other (current) actual Workers in the Group. If you are close friends with one of the Applicants, or for other reasons find yourself in a conflict of interest (regardless of direction) you must disclose this to the Lead, so they can select who to assign for you.

Only if there are no valid Applicants to consider, can the opening be extended past what is stated in the Opening.

### Assigned
Once the JOYtask is Assigned, the Role of the JOYtask Manager is to:
- Follow up anything specified in the Opening (eg. make sure the Applicant reports progress as agreed)
- Answer the Applicants questions, and assist them if applicable (not actually helping them complete the task)

### Completion
Regardless of the above, the JOYtask Manager MUST create a Proposal after an Assignee has completed their work or gotten dropped, and ask the Lead to fire them from the Group.

#### Success
Assuming the Assignee has completed their Work within the time allotted, the JOYtask Manager must grade the work within the time stated in the Opening. This means:
- Short summary of the selection process
- Provide link(s) to all the work and relevant communication (questions, nagging, feedback)
- Summary of the grading process
- Grading comments
- A USD denominated reward, taking both the submitted work, and anything else that, in line with the Opening, can influence the reward, in to account

This information shall be added a Spending Proposal, where the Assignee(s) Member account is the recipient of the Reward. It must also be shared with the Lead.

Finally, the Assignee is "fired" from the OP-G group, presumably getting their stake(s) returned.

#### Bad Outcomes

##### Time Elapsed
If the Assignee does NOT submit any work in time (assuming no extension has been given), the Assignee should get fired right away, and, if in line with the Opening, slashed. A Text Proposal, with the same information as if it was a success, must be created.

##### Poor Work
If the submitted work isn't worth any reward, the Assignee should get fired right away, and, if in line with the Opening, slashed. A Text Proposal, with the same information as if it was a success, must be created.

##### Assignee Quits
If the Assignee has had to stake for the JOYtask, and they are unwilling or unable to complete their work, they may attempt to quit the role in order to avoid getting slashed. If the Assignee asks to be "relieved" from their obligations, the JOYtask Manager MAY consider obliging, only impacting their reputation. If they simply quit, the JOYtask Manager must fire them ASAP, slashing their entire stake.

As for any other outcome, a (Text) Proposal must be created.

## Lead
Most of the Lead specific tasks, related to JOYtasks, can be deduced from reading the [JOYtask Participant](#joytask-participant) and [JOYtask Manager](joytask-manager).

### Term Start
#### Budgets and Rewards
Every new Council Term, once the JOYtasks and global budget is in, a budget for the Working Group will be published. This means the Lead will need to perform some of these actions:
- Review the (expected) workload, and assign JOYtasks
- Adjust the reward of the Workers (based on the JOYtask distribution)
- Hire new Workers (if there's a need for more manpower, and the budget allows it)
- Fire no longer needed, or underperforming Workers

Note that payments to the Workers (and yourself) should be set in advance. If a Worker performs poorly, or doesn't show up, slash and/or fire them sooner rather than later.

#### JOYtasks
A summary of the Lead specific tasks outlined before:
- Assign JOYtask Managers (can assign yourself)
- Based on input/request from the aforementioned Managers:
  - Set Openings to Review Stage (at request)
  - Hire the Assignees
  - If required, address Appeals

### Term End
#### JOYtasks
At the end of Each Term, go through ALL the Openings and Proposals created for the JOYtasks and create a summary report that includes (for each JOYtask):
- links and info
- timestamps of events:
  - JOYtask published
  - opening made
  - hiring of the Assignee
  - work submitted
  - proposal(s) submitted
  - proposal(s) outcome
  - if required:
    - appeal(s) made
    - ...
    - outcome
- update the "Reputation" for each Assignee, based on the outcome only
- update the "Reputation" for each JOYtask Manager, based on the Assignee survey(s) and the outcomes

#### OKRs
Towards the end of the Term, the OKR results will come in. This means that OKR rewards are paid out to the Lead, and some performance numbers for the Group will be presented.

The Lead must then:
- Parse the Group results, and use them to evaluate the performance of each Worker
- Distribute the rewards in accordance with the "OKR distribution table"
- Warn/slash/fire/praise Workers in line with their performance

# Content Curators
## Scope of Work
- Change the "Featured Video Hero" daily
- Change the "Discover Categories" daily
- Change the "Featured Videos" (on chain) daily
- Review ALL Channels that are created or updated every day
- Review ALL videos that are uploaded or updated every day
- Approve all new submissions to all Content Competitions (will be JOYtasks)

### Recurring Rewards
At the very least, the Lead will earn a significant Recurring Reward. The Workers likely less so, (although the Lead may decide otherwise) as their rewards should (at least once the system settles), be more dependent on OKRs.

### OKRs
Some ideas for what can be measured through OKRs:
- How long did the average video/channel that was censored up BEFORE it was censored
- How many videos/channels should have been censored, but wasn't
- Did the Group manage to uphold their deadlines? If not, by how much

Lead Only:
- How well did the Lead manage the groups budget (if they "saved" the platform money -> reward, if they overspent -> punish)?
- Did the Lead finish their [Term Start](#term-start) work on time?
- Did the Lead finish their [Term End](#term-end) work on time?

## Lead
### Budgets and Rewards
Every new Council Term, once the JOYtasks and global budget is in, a budget for the Working Group will be published. This means the Lead will need to perform some of these actions:
- Adjust the reward of the Workers
- Hire new Workers (if there's a need for more manpower, and the budget allows it)
- Fire no longer needed, or underperforming, Workers
- Review the (expected) workload, and (re-)assign tasks

Note that payments to the Workers (and yourself) should be set in advance. If a Worker performs poorly, or doesn't show up, slash and/or fire them sooner rather than later.

### Monitor Workers and Tasks
Continuously:
- monitor the performance of the Workers
- ensure all tasks are dealt with within the defined timeframe (or within a reasonable time, if nothing is defined)
- re-assign tasks, if a Worker is unable to perform their tasks (for whatever reason)
- assist the Workers
- pay attention to the Forum, Proposals and Discord to see if anything comes up

### OKRs
Towards the end of the Term, the OKR results will come in. This means that OKR rewards are paid out to the Lead, and some performance numbers for the Group will be presented.

The Lead must then:
- Parse the Group results, and use them to evaluate the performance of each Worker
- Distribute the rewards in accordance with the "OKR distribution table"
- Warn/slash/fire/praise Workers in line with their performance

### Report
Write a report of the events of the Term:
- How much did the group spend
- What tasks were on the agenda for the Term (both recurring and JOYtasks)
- Who was assigned what
- What was achieved, what was not achieved, what went well, what went poorly
- Comment on the OKR results, and what the outcomes were
- Comment on the performance of the Workers that was not captured by the OKRs
- Comment on the workload/reward ratio, and request (potential) changes to the budget


# Council
Finalizing the Council reward system is the most difficult to settle at the moment. From experience, it will be hard to make this objective.

## Scope of Work
The main, recurring tasks for the Council:
- Proposal Voting:
  - JOYtask Proposals
  - ...
- Manage the WG Leads
  - Set WG budgets
  - Review the Leads Term Reports
  - Find/generate the OKR results
    - Distribute the OKR rewards to the group Lead
  - Hire, and discipline (fire/slash/warn) Leads
- Council specific JOYtasks
  - These will be similar to what is currently in `Section I` of the "old" KPI system
  - Create JOYtasks (CMs can't participate)

## Rewards
The Council's reward will flow from these sources:
- Recurring Rewards
- Council JOYtasks
  - Specific, non-recurring tasks that are made exclusively for the Council Members
  - Will likely be graded by the OP-G group, as with the rest of them
- OKRs

### Recurring Rewards
From experience, setting these too high will result in "squatting", so they'll likely be rather small.

### Council JOYtasks
Specific, non-recurring tasks that are made exclusively for the Council Members. Will likely be graded by the OP-G group, as with the rest of them. See [JOYtask Participants](#joytask-participants) for general information.

### OKRs
Some ideas for KPIs that may work:
- Proposal handling (response time, etc)
- How well did the Council manage the platforms budget (if they "saved" the platform money -> reward, if they overspent -> punish)?
- The results for each of the individual WGs OKRs. If a group did well -> the Council did well.

# Operations Group Alpha
This Operations Group will continue to focus on the technical aspects, and the group will largely consist of developers and designers.

## Scope of Work
The group will have some recurring tasks, that has been somewhat neglected until now, but this will hopefully change. Examples:
- Maintaining and improving API scripts.
- Make improvements to existing infrastructure (Pioneer 1.0, Pioneer 2.0, Atlas, CLI, Query Node)
  - For the relevant Joystream github repos, a new label `community` is created, and an hour estimate is added.
- Testing of new tools
- Create, deploy and maintain scripts for (other WGs) OKRs

It's expected that both the Council, various WG Leads and the Community at large will request further assistance from the group.
Historically, the group have also frequently requested funding for internally generated tasks, which will likely make out a large part of their workload.

All these tasks should also include an estimate on hours, or costs.

### Rewards
The OP-A WG reward will flow from these sources:
- Recurring Rewards
- OKRs
- Specific, non-recurring tasks

#### Recurring Rewards
For a group with few "grinding" tasks, the recurring reward may be rather small.

#### OKRs
As for the other WGs, it should be possible to create an OKR system, but it's not clear how well it will work. Possible ways of arranging it:
- For all the issues "solved" by the OP-A group, with the `community` label, sum up the hours.
  - Possibly, also assign an hour (or USD) to any other task created as well, but the issue here would be setting a "fair" value. The OP-A can't do this themselves, and it's not clear who else could.
  - If we could get a good system here, this would be the best way to do it all.

# Operations Group Beta
This Operations Group will focus on marketing, and community support. In a perfect world, the group will need to cast a wide net, and gather workers with all kinds of skills:
- Marketing
- Design
- Writers
- Media (production)
- Platform knowledge

In addition to that, it would need people that are simply willing to put in the hours, and monitor communication channels.

## Scope of Work
The group would be responsible for the following tasks:
- Be welcoming and supportive towards new and old user on Discord, Telegram, the forum and other places
- Design, schedule and run marketing campaigns, in close collaboration with the Jsgenesis team (where applicable)
- Membership screening
- Create, test, and distribute surveys
  - Including the JOYtask surveys
- Create assets for marketing and instructional videos, blog posts, etc.
  - Video Term summaries
  - Community calls
  - etc.

### Recurring Rewards
For things like a high presence on social media, recurring rewards seems like the most effective incentives.

### OKRs
As for the other WGs, it should be possible to create an OKR system, but it's not clear how well it will work. Possible ways of arranging it:
- For all the marketing issues "solved" by the OP-B group, with the `community` label, sum up the hours.
- Amount of new "verified" users to the platform, attributable to the work of the group
- How many of the users being Assigned a JOYtask responded to the survey within some time

## Lead
### Monitor Workers and Tasks
Continuously:
- monitor the performance of the Workers
- ensure all tasks are dealt with within the defined timeframe (or within a reasonable time, if nothing is defined)
- re-assign tasks, if a Worker is unable to perform their tasks (for whatever reason)
- assist the Workers
- pay attention to the Forum, Proposals and Discord to see if anything relevant to the group comes up

### Budgets and Rewards
Every new Council Term, a budget for the Working Group will be published. This means the Lead will need to perform some of these actions:
- Review the (expected) workload, and (re-)assign tasks
- Adjust the reward of the Workers
- Hire new Workers (if there's a need for more manpower, and the budget allows it)
- Fire no longer needed, or underperforming Workers

### OKRs
Towards the end of the Term, the OKR results will come in. This means that OKR rewards are paid out to the Lead, and some performance numbers for the Group will be presented.

The Lead must then:
- Parse the Group results, and use them to evaluate the performance of each Worker
- Distribute the rewards in accordance with the "OKR distribution table"
- Warn/slash/fire/praise Workers in line with their performance

#### Report
Write a report of the events of the Term:
- How much did the group spend
- What tasks were on the agenda for the Term
- Who was assigned what
- What was achieved, what was not achieved, what went well, what went poorly
- Comment on the OKR results, and what the outcomes were
- Comment on the performance of the Workers that was not captured by the OKRs
- Comment on the workload/reward ratio, and request (potential) changes to the budget


Note that payments to the Workers (and yourself) should be set in advance. If a Worker performs poorly, or doesn't show up, slash and/or fire them sooner rather than later.

# Storage and Distribution Groups
The tasks, and incentive scheme for these two groups will be very similar, although the specifics for the OKRs will of course vary quite a bit. Whereas the Workers in the group will likely be able to learn a lot on the job, and need not be more than "comfortable" using the linux command line, the Leads will need to acquire a good understanding of the Storage System at large.

## Scope of Work
The group will in any event be responsible for ensuring the storage system has:
- fast and reliable service (high uptime)
- redundancy of storage and distribution
- geographical distribution

### Recurring Rewards
As there is a non-trivial fixed cost associated with operating this role, the recurring rewards will have to reflect that.

### OKRs
For these two WGs, designing an OKR system will be rather easy, and the results will be a very reliable source of measuring their actual performance (it will of course require iterations).
- Upload speed
- Download speed
- "Correct" redundancy
- High uptime across nodes
- Geographical location distribution
- Cost management

## Lead
The leads will, in addition to running the nodes themselves, monitor the system.

### Monitor Workers and Tasks
Continuously:
- monitor, and adjust, the system configuration
- monitor the performance of the Workers
- assist the Workers
- pay attention to the Forum, Proposals and Discord to see if anything relevant to the group comes up

### Budgets and Rewards
Every new Council Term, a budget for the Working Group will be published. This means the Lead will need to perform some of these actions:
- Review the (expected) workload, and (re-)assign tasks
- Adjust the reward of the Workers
- Hire new Workers (if there's a need for more manpower, and the budget allows it)
- Fire no longer needed, or underperforming Workers

### OKRs
Towards the end of the Term, the OKR results will come in. This means that OKR rewards are paid out to the Lead, and some performance numbers for the Group will be presented.

The Lead must then:
- Parse the Group results, and use them to evaluate the performance of each Worker
- Distribute the rewards in accordance with the "OKR distribution table"
- Warn/slash/fire/praise Workers in line with their performance
