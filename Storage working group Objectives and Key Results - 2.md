## Uptime-2

In my opinion This is the most critical KPI thats why it’s very strict 

| Criteria                                                    | Action                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| When the node is down & URL is not set to empty < 12 hours  | salary*100%                            |
| When the node is down & URL is not set to empty > 12 hours  | salary*50%                             |
| When the node is down & URL is not set to empty > 48 hours  |  storage provider can be replaced.     |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Free storage > [storage size (now) - storage size (3 months ago) ]* 3           | salary*100%                            |
| Free storage < [storage size (now) - storage size (3 months ago) ]* 3 -         | salary*50%                             |
| Free storage < [storage size (now) ]   |  storage provider can be replaced.     |                                        |
 

## Concentration  AS/ hosting providers

| Criteria                                                                        | Action                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |

If it’s not clear who is the last one, one SP will be chosen to change AS within 1 week time. If no change after 1 week, it will reduced in salaries all SPs can be reduced in on 50% After 2 weeks it can be replaced.  |

## Usefull iformation
Sanctions are not compounded. If there are few, the most strict will be applied.

If there are 100% salary - no sanctions- for 6 months, additional 1 salary can be rewarded.
