Main quality criteria for Storage Providers are highlighted here https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/blob/master/governance/Storage_WG_OKR.md



KPIs are measured by means dashboard 
3 day is a time to fix any is

KPIs

Uptime-1
>90% (27/30 days) - salary*100%
<90% - salary*50%
<50% - storage provider can be replaced 

Uptime-2
When the node is down
URL is not set to empty < 12 hours - salary*100%
URL is not set to empty > 12 hours  - salary*50%
URL is not set to empty > 48 hours - storage provider can be replaced 
(depends on the explanation)

In my opinion This is the most critical KPI thats why it’s very strict 

Free storage
Free storage > [storage size (now) - storage size (3 months ago) ]* 3 - salary * 100%
Free storage < [storage size (now) - storage size (3 months ago) ]* 3 - salary * 50%
Free storage < [storage size (now) ] for more than 3 days - storage provider can be replaced 

Concentration  AS/ hosting providers
Providers are in the AS with concentration of concentration of SPs in a single AS should not exceed 50% 
The last one to join should change AS. If it’s not clear who is the last one, one SP will be chosen to change AS within 1 week time.
If no change after 1 week, it will reduced in salaries all SPs can be reduced in on 50% After 2 weeks it can be replaced. 

Sanctions are not compounded. If there are few, the most strict will be applied.

If there are 100% salary - no sanctions- for 6 months, additional 1 salary can be rewarded.
